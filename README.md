#Project: Models of Machine Learning based semantic text analysis. 

@authors: Adam Zuba, Paweł Ciślik, Agnija Bogdaniuk, Supervision: prof. dr. hab. inż. Grzegorz Nalepa

Regonising the semantic valence of a text is a complex function. The goal of the project was to train and choose the best Machine Learning model for recognising the emotional valence of a text, adjusting for the multi-factor influences. The models were trained and used in both the English and Polish languages. The database for the Polish langauge was scrapped with a script from the internet (from a populer film reviews website - filmweb.pl).

The project was developed in Jupyter Notebook IDE, using Keras ML framework with TensorFlow backend, following an online Machine-Learning Tutorial and under a supervisor of prof. dr. hab. inż. Grzegorz Nalepa. The project was a course project for the class of Workshops in Cognitive Engineering at Jagiellonian University.

______________
The project implemented:

- Selected filters, machine learning techniques, and text complexity.

0. Scrapping data from the internet to get the database for the Polish language
1. Data pre-processing
2. Data tokenisation
3. Implementing Naive Bayes interpreter 
4. Preparing the Embeddeding Layer
5. Implementing Simple Neural Network
6. Implementing Convolutional Neural Network
7. Implementing Recurrent Neural Network

- Analyzed and compared the effectiveness of models with reconigising the advantages and disadvantages of each model, as well as leading factors that influence the model score.
